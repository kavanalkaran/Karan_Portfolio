# [Project 1 - Luxury Car Prices - A Study.](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj)
* Created a tool that estimates luxury car prices and gives various analysis results based on essential parameters that affect the pricing of a luxury car.
* Scraped over descriptions adn databases from various sources using python and sql.
* Engineered features from the text of each car's description to quantify the value companies put on the essential paramaters.
* Used Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib to reach the best model.

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier](https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier)
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
