# Karan Vinod Kavanal - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Karan! I have an analytical background in Automobile and currentlly I am working with Bepec Solutions as a Data Analyst. I have developed a strong foundation in the Automotive sector and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies and work, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV in [pdf](https://github.com/kavanalkaran/Karan_Portfolio/blob/main/KaranKavanal_Resume.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Movie Recommender System
**Code:** [`Movie Recommender System.ipynb`](https://github.com/kavanalkaran/Data_Science_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System%20Project.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's recommendation.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### D - Mart Store Sales Data Analysis

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`D - Mart Store Sales Data Analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/kavanalkaran/Data_Science_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.

### Luxury Cars Price Analysis Project
**Code:** [`Luxury Cars Price Analysis Project.ipynb`](https://github.com/kavanalkaran/Data_Science_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Luxury%20Cars%20Price%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** 
* Created a tool that estimates luxury car prices and gives various analysis results based on essential parameters that affect the pricing of a luxury car.
* Scraped over descriptions adn databases from various sources using python and sql.
* Engineered features from the text of each car's description to quantify the value companies put on the essential paramaters.

**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** Used Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib


### Data Analysis and Price Prediction of Electric Vehicles
**Code:** [`Data Analysis and Price Prediction of Electric Vehicles.ipynb`](https://github.com/kavanalkaran/Data_Science_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Price%20Prediction%20of%20Electric%20Vehicles.ipynb)

**Description:** 
* Created a tool that estimates EV car prices and gives various analysis results based on essential parameters that affect the pricing of an electric car.
* Scraped over descriptions adn databases from various sources using python and sql.
* Engineered features from the text of each car's description to quantify the value companies put on the essential paramaters.
 This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Technology:** Used Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib
